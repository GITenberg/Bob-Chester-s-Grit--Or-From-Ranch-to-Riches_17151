description: '"Bob Chester had always wanted to go back West.  In fact, love of the
  West was in Bob''s blood, for his father before him had been a rancher in Oklahoma.  But
  at Mr. Chester''s death, the boy was sent East and placed under the guardianship
  pf Len Dardus, a miserly and unscrupulous old grocer.  The father had left a letter
  for his son, with the instructions that he should open it on his tenth birthday,
  and so for several years now Bob had known that his father had left five thousand
  dollars for him.  Life as Mr. Dardus'' grocery helper becomes more and more intolerable,
  and Bob makes up his mind that he will go West.  However, when he asks his guardian
  for the money.  The father was insane at the time of his death, Mr. Dardus explains,
  and merely imagined that he had the five thousand dollars.  Consequently, all that
  Bob has in the world is the fifteen dollars which he has managed to save from his
  two-dollar-a-week wages.  And so, with much grit and little else, Bob starts out.  How
  he overcomes his obstacles makes an interesting success story"--Dust jkt.'
